# Spotify Art + Code Generator

![preview](preview.png)

Spotify used to display its album / artist / track art and Spotify code in one picture after clicking the kebab menu. This still works on mobile, but not in the web player nor in the desktop version.

This script generates a merged image of the respective art and code.

This is a hobby project, therefore things break at any time. Use at your own risk.
